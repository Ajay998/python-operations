The session is a semi-permanent and two-way communication between the server and the browser.

Let’s understand this technical definition in detail. Here semi means that session will exist until the user logs out or closes the browser.
The two-way communication means that every time the browser/client makes a request, the server receives the request and cookies containing specific parameters
and a unique Session ID which the server generates to identify the user.
The Session ID doesn’t change for a particular session, but the website generates it every time a new session starts.
