manage.py- This file is used to interact with your project via the command line(start the server, sync the database… etc).

_init_.py – It is a python package. It is invoked when the package or a module in the package is imported.
We usually use this to execute package initialization code, for example for the initialization of package-level data.

settings.py – As the name indicates it contains all the website settings.
In this file, we register any applications we create, the location of our static files, database configuration details, etc.

urls.py – In this file, we store all links of the project and functions to call.

wsgi.py – This file is used in deploying the project in WSGI. It is used to help your Django application communicate with the webserver.

BASE_DIR
BASE_DIR points to the top hierarchy of the project i.e. mysite, whatever paths we define in the project are all relative to BASE_DIR.
To use BASE_DIR we will have to use os module provided by Python.
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

DEBUG
In Development Error is very obvious to occur. There is no fun in writing a program where we do not face any error.
but sometimes tackling errors is very hectic. Django provides an inbuilt Debugger which makes the developer’s life very easy. We can use it by doing:
DEBUG = True  // It is Default value and is preferred in only Development Phase.
In production, DEBUG = False is preferred.

ALLOWED_HOSTS
ALLOWED_HOSTS is a list having addresses of all domains which can run your Django Project.
ALLOWED_HOSTS can be an empty list i.e. ALLOWED_HOSTS=[ ] because by Default it is 127.0.0.1 or localhost
When DEBUG set to False
ALLOWED_HOSTS can not be an empty list. We have to give hosts name in list. i.e. ALLOWED_HOSTS=[“127.0.0.1”, “*.heroku.com”].
“127.0.0.1” represents Your PC, “*.heroku.com” represents this application can be run on heroku also.

INSTALLED_APPS
In this section, we mention all apps that will be used in our Django project.

DATABASES
Django officially supports the following databases:
PostgreSQL
MariaDB
MySQL
Oracle
SQLite <– By Default

DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': YOUR_DB_NAME,
            'USER': USERNAME,
            'PASSWORD': PASSWORD_FOR_DB,
            'HOST': 'localhost'  // in Development.
        }
    }


MEDIA_URL:
MEDIA_URL is the relative path to BASE_DIR. This variable is used to store the media files.
MEDIA_URL= '/media/'

STATIC_URL:
STATIC_URL is the relative path to BASE_DIR. This variable is used to store the static files.
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

MEDIA_ROOT:
MEDIA_ROOT is an absolute path. This variable is used to retrieve the media files.
MEDIA_ROOT= os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

STATIC_ROOT:
STATIC_ROOT is an absolute path. This variable is used to retrieve the static files.
STATIC_ROOT= os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
