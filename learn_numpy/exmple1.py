# NumPy gives you an enormous range of fast and efficient ways of creating arrays and manipulating numerical data inside them.
# While a Python list can contain different data types within a single list, all of the elements in a NumPy array should be homogeneous.
# The mathematical operations that are meant to be performed on arrays would be extremely inefficient if the arrays werenâ€™t homogeneous.

# NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use.
# NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.
# This allows the code to be optimized even further.
